# Welcome to Cocoom

## Our Philosophy

> 🌟 We help organizations share knowledge transparently across teams and departments. We believe that making knowledge accessible builds trust and empowers everyone in your company.

## What is Cocoom?

Cocoom is an internal communication platform that allows you to centralize and share information within your teams, while energizing the knowledge already present in your organization.

**Each Cocoom account is a dedicated workspace with:**

- A custom URL (you can choose your own subdomain at creation time)
- Content and structure you control
- User access you manage

**No technical expertise required.** Our intuitive interface makes it simple to create and manage your knowledge base, even if you're not tech-savvy.
